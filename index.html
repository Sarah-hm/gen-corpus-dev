        <p id = "project-abstract">Data Patterns is a project and research on how digitally generated and collected data impact consumerist objects, especially within clothing and fashion. While researching on this topic, I found myself reminiscing paper trails of pre-computer artisanship. Indeed, we are rapidly losing traces of analog history which have not been translated into our modern world. Genevieve, my ever-moving grandmother, lost all her fashion designs, papers and patterns through her life. By creating a community-based corpus of digitalized paper sewing patterns, I wish to construct a tool allowing ‘material’ media to impact our modern tools, such as AI, in a permanent fashion.</p>

            Stuck in the battle between copy rights infringements and critical analysis of creativity itself, many fail to conceive of AI or ‘AI art’ as one of the artist’s many tools. Commercial and artistically geared AI systems access almost uncontrollable amounts of data which the individual user has no power on. Moreover, these systems lack large amounts of data created before the digital age, namely those of artists and artisans. By creating a community-based corpus of historical sewing patterns, my goal is not only to prototype with a more controlled pool of data but also to ensure artisanship’s legacy in the digital age.

            While trying to conceive of new ways humans and machines could work together, I came to explore technologies such as Dall-e, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. My goal was to generate shapes that looked like sewing patterns and interpretate them into wearable clothing pieces. Although the research was conclusive in finding some methodologies for artisanship and AI to collaborate, the fact I had no control on the data I was fetching from meant I had little control on what I could receive. Instead of the anticipated technical 2D sewing patterns, all I received were silhouettes of already worn clothes. Creating a very specific corpus of sewing patterns will therefore allow more accurate results in the next stages of the research.

            While creating a better tool for research, this project also aims to ensure that analog data of artists and artisans, especially patternmakers and seamstresses, are transferred to the digital realm. Both my grandmother’s lost paper-trails of her designer’s past and my best friend’s grandmother’s old sewing patterns’ collection she’s given me were my inspiration for this project. However, my hope is to gather more collections of personal and commercial analog patterns coming from all times and spaces. The resources of this grant will be used to find and collect those historical paper pattern collections and digitalize them using specialized equipment.

            My research prompted the creation of this sewing patterns corpus which it will become a valuable tool for. However, it will hopefully live on to also become an open source and community-based space where one can share and find once analog patterns free of rights.
